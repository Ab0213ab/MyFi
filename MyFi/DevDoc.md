# Feature: Build Budget Tracker Functionality

## Overview
Implement the foundational Budget Tracker system in MyFi. This includes allowing users to define monthly budgets,
allocate spending limits across categories, and view expense totals compared to their budget goals. The system 
should serve as the backbone for future financial insights and ChatGPT-powered analysis.
